## Realtime API

- Azure OpenAI GPT-4o Realtime API for speech and audio is part of the GPT-4o model family that supports low-latency, "speech in, speech out" conversational interactions. The GPT-4o audio realtime API is designed to handle real-time, low-latency conversational interactions, making it a great fit for use cases involving live interactions between a user and a model, such as customer support agents, voice assistants, and real-time translators.

- API documentation is available to provide detailed information on endpoints, request/response formats, and usage examples. Refer to the [Realtime API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/realtime-audio-quickstart?pivots=ai-foundry-portal) for comprehensive API documentation.
